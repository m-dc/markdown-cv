### Summary

I have recently been diagnosed with **ASD**, which has allowed me to accept how life has turned out for me. Whilst I like to help people, too much social interaction burns me out. It dawned upon me that **Software tester** may be my calling. I excel at **pattern recognition** and I'm also a bit of a **creative mind**. Hardening **security** rivets me. Bug bounties writeups and ctfs peak my interest. Software tester would be the perfect gateway for me to not only enjoy these interests more, but also be usefull by helping out businesses in a way that I find **meaningfull**. Nonetheless, It must be noted that I do not excel at direct customer support. 

### Currently

Student @[19](https://www.s19.be/nl/) (42) in Brussels & [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science).

### Education

`2014 - 2017`
__Digital Arts and Entertainment__
Gamedev, but I failed groups assignments because of undiagnosed ASD and heightened stress to a level that I didn't dare show up anymore.
  
`2017 - 2018`
__Cevora - System and network Administration Windows | Cisco networking academy__

`Mar 2021 - Jan 2022`
__19 coding school Brussels | 42 institute__
Low level C where one builds libraries from scratch to use in all following assesments. Perfection is the baseline to pass an assignment. The whole structure is built around a peer-review process, which isn't ideal for me since I don't like that. I felt a bit alienated by the overwhelming majority of native french speakers. I much prefer to study alone and to maybe have a mentor that I can contact on the odd occasion that i need him. But having to deal with people for no apparent reason, that's something that I can't wrap my head around.
 
### Experience

`Aug 2018 - May 2019`
__Yaska - technical support engineer | System admin__
Yaska (Apple consultant) was looking for someone to:
[1]  Help them out with their managed Windows and Linux servers
[2]  Assist their support team.
[3]  Be in charge of (1) their Solarwinds dashboards, (2) windows and linux servers, (3) DNS configuration, (4) proxy and VPN services and (5) Azure and Intune environment.
  
`Sep 2019 - April 2020`
__Evonik Porphyrio NV - IoT support & network | System admin__
IoT for the poultry industry. I honestly don't understand why I ever signed up for this. Imagine supporting poultry farmers with undiagnosed ASD. I had high hopes to learn something from their IoT and cloud infrastructure, but those quickly turned into ash. They burdened me with tasks that nobody wanted but also put me in a hole that I imagine no sane person could ever crawl out from. The people were great though. I felt mismanaged, I felt despair.

I was fascinated by devops. but for this one requires devops experience, which in se means survive as support for a couple of years to become a sysadmin. I simply cannot survive as customer support.

### Hobbies
Investing | board games | chess, shogi, go | reading | gaming | Japanology | piano
